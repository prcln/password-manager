# password-manager
An application to store your passwords if you don't trust Google

The script will create 3 dependent files to work
If you delete some of them, the app will automatically reset (hope so)

Ehe, I want to create an application to suit my needs :3
I created this project with the help of ChatGPT and GeeksForGeeks

Feel free to comment!
